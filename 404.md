!["A new hand touches the beacon. Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy. Return my beacon to Mount Kilkreath. And I will make you the instrument of my cleansing light."](https://github.com/SamsyTheUnicorn/SamsyTheUnicorn.github.io/blob/main/404Meridia.png?raw=true)
