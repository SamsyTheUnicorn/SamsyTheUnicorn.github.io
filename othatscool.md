# OThat'sCool
> ***!beep boop!*** 
> This is experimental, and I can't place any guarantees on stability or quality as we have not had any saves reach 100h of playtime to analyse yet for bloat and other issues. If you run into any issues with the additions, drop your save file in the [Arisen Discord](https://discord.gg/WakingDreams)'s *#arisen-additions* along with a note of any other additions you have made, and a copy of your crash log. Do not directly message me for support. 

### OTC01: OStim and OpenSex
Before downloading and installing anything, create a separator in Mod Organiser and name it "[NoDelete] OThat'sCool", all your mods related to this guide should be sorted under here, I will instruct you to name installed mods in a specific way so you can update Arisen and easily locate all your mods in-order to sort them again.

### OTC02-09: OStim Addons
These addons are chosen from OStim NG's featured addons. I have avoided mods that try to touch every NPC like Fertility Mode, ORomance, or ONights. I have also ignored most of the addons from [Ferret's OStim Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3751) as the addons are either not things I am interested in such as Lactis and ODefeat or Yamete Kudasai﻿, or not fully stable/functional like OStrap, and OLycanthrope. <br>The addons are sorted into their own little groups:

On Choose your compatibility patch, choose "OpenSex compatibility patch with Feet pack", on Animations just hit Next, on Thank you for using the patch! hit Install. Enable the mod.

### OTC10: Physics (The Jiggly Bits)
The physics for bodies packaged with Arisen is a *bit* tight, fortunately Felivath has been working on some improved physics for scenes.

Download their edited files from MEGA [here](https://mega.nz/file/5A5jWCwZ#OAMU1gsYvw4OPUPLqAG_dNhDj1L2xdzBtijs5Wa6Jks) and install manually in MO2 as "[NoDelete] (OTC10) Felivath's 3BA-CBPC-SMP Edits" and enable. <br>Under "Animations - Foundation" disable "CBPC - Physics with Collisions", "CBPC 3-Bone Breast Body", "3BA 3BBB CBPC Realistic Firm Breasts Butt Belly and Thighs (3BA RFBBBT)", and "3BA RFBBBT v3.0 - AutoGibbon Settings - Update 3". <br>Under "Graphics - Skin, Body, & Head" disable "CBBE 3BA".

### Bringing (Load) Order to the Realm: Synthesis and Nemesis
You can find the Mod and Load order for OThat'sCool on LoadOrderLibrary [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/apotheosis-othatscool). <br>Once you have matched the positions for the new plugins, run Synthesis to update your patches and then Nemesis to update your animation library.

### Unbound and MCM
Now you can finally start the game, huzzah!

Buuuut there is still more work to be done. Launch the game and instead of loading the initial Unbound save game, go to start a New Game. Once the game loads up, wait until all notifications disappear from the top-left hand corner of the screen. <br>Open the Main Menu and open the MCM Settings, the first mod you will need to go to is **MCM Recorder**, choose to play the "Arisen Start Save", run the recording and wait for a message that the recording is complete. <br> In the options for **CBBE 3BA**, Change the "Toggle Player Physics Hotkey" and "NPC Physics Toggle Spell" to hotkeys you can use such as "K" and "L" or "[" and "]" for easily toggling physics to SMP before a scene. <br>In the options for **OStim**, under Configuration/Sex Scenes disable "Actors control speed" and set "Excitement multiplier" to 3.00, under Configuration/Undressing disable "Remove clothes mid-scene" and enable "Fully undress at start", under Configuration/Ai Control disable everything except "Force full-auto control for masturbation" and set "AI Animation Change Chance" to 1, under Configuration/Beds disable "Use Beds", under Add-ons/OCum set "Cum Regeneration Modifier" to 2.0. <br>In the options for **OPrivacy**, enable "Disable Privacy Requests" and "Males", disable "OStim scenes Increase Relationship", and "Enable/Disable Approach". <br>In the options for **OComfort**, disable "Only active with Spouse". <br>In the options for **SexLab Solutions - Ostim**, disable "Beggars", "Drunks", and "Housecarls".

Now do any other MCM changes you'd like, such as setting up your new start in Unbound, or changing spawns for Immersive Creatures. Go back to the OStim MCM Settings, and scroll to the bottom of the Configuration settings then press "Rebuild animation database", as the message says, close everything and then open the console, make sure the message "OStim: Unloaded Database" appears. <br>Wait a minute more and then made a manual save, you will use this for any new characters using OThat'sCool.

#### Thank You
Thanks to the Arisen community. <br>Thanks to Felivath for testing OStim and working on the physics. <br> Thanks to Ferret and Ace for their great OStim installation guides.
